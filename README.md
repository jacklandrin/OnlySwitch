## Hiding new Macbook Notch 

The Hide notch switch only shows on the built-in display of M1 Pro/Max Macbook Pro. The switch just controls the current desktop, not all work desktops.
Now, the Hide notch switch supports dynamic wallpaper, just the processing takes a much longer time.

## Only Widget

Only Switch supports Apple Widgets since version 2.5.0. The Widgets can be edited to any built-in switches and buttons. Clicking them will trigger the reflection of relevant switches and buttons. You can put Only Widgets anywhere, desktop or notification center.

Since version 2.5.2, Only Widget supports Evolution.

**NOTE:** After updating version 2.5.0, you might need to reset your language. If your widgets didn't follow your language settings, please kill Only Widget process, it will update.

## Evolution🔥
Evolution has come following version 2.4, you can freely DIY the switches and buttons that you want. Currently, evolution supports **Shell** and **Apple Script**. They also can be invoked by hotkeys. Next, evolution will be able to be distributed by users as a shortcut utility platform.

Evolution settings page is implemented with TCA.
PS: Evolution feature needs macOS 13.0 and above.

Everyone can contribute Evolution for OnlySwitch since version 2.4.3. Please read [How to contribute to Evolution Gallery](EvolutionGalleryContributing.md). The shared Evolutions will be displayed here:

### How to create an Evolution?
So far, Evolution offers two types, with Switch and Button. 
1. Button is very simple, when Run button is pressed, the script you added will be executed.
2. Regarding Switch, there are four fields you can edit.
* Check status: When OnlySwitch list appeared or some settings are changed, the switch status will be checked whether on or off. At this moment, the script of check status will be executed. You can press the debug button to output the result of this script.
* True condition: You can input a true condition to define what is on or off for the switch status. If the true condition matches the output result, the status will be on, and vice versa.
* Turn on: the script can change the status to on.
* Turn off: the script can change the status to off.

The debug button can verify if your scripts are valid. Before you save evolution, all scripts must pass the test.

## AirPods Switch 
I use `classOfDevice`(2360344) to check if a Bluetooth device is Airpods Pro, but I'm not sure whether other AirPods modules are also 2360344, since I only have two AirPods Pros. If you are using AirPods 1~3, please tell me what the `classOfDevice` is. Or I can detect the count of battery value to check if AirPods (when the count is 3, it's AirPods), like **AirPods Battery Monitor For MAC OS**.

## Radio Player
Radio Player supports m3u, and aac stream, but without sound wave effect. Please send me the crash log and stream URL if your Radio Player crashes. You can close the sound wave effect on the Radio setting, and that player is AVPlayer, more stable. In version 2.3.5, the radio play can be set to enable/disabled. If the function is disabled, the switch will be invisible in the list, and the radio player will be unregistered from Now Playing(But I don't know why there will be a little delay. It should be a problem by macOS).

Since Version 2.3.11, the radio list can be exported and imported.

## Low Power Mode
Low Power Mode uses Terminal commands that require root access, so the app will ask you to enter the password on every toggle.

## Screen Test & Clean
In Version 2.3, Only Switch brings a new feature, Screen Test. It provides a pure color view in full-screen mode, you can check dead pixels via it. Press the left and right arrow keys, the color will change from black, white, red, green, and blue. This functionality also can be used for screen cleaning, as you can see the stains on the screen.

## Hide Menu Bar Icons
This feature is new in version 2.3.2. To be honest, Hidden and Dozer are both good apps for this function. Many users install OnlySwitch and them simultaneously, but this also squeezes the menu bar, which is already lacking in space. Therefore, the feature integrates into OnlySwitch.
![](https://github.com/jacklandrin/OnlySwitch/assets/3782279/fdda284e-929f-400e-aba5-9c628f065de6)
When the switch is on, items on the left of the split(arrow-pointing) icon are hidden. Hold ⌘ (command) and drag the icon to configure the hidden section. If you want to use it no longer, you can disable it in preferences, the split icon will disappear. You also can set the interval of autohide for it here. If your date on the menu bar is truncated when it's on, you can set this: System Preferences -> Dock & Menu Bar -> Clock -> Show date -> always.

Since version 2.3.10, this switch can be controlled via right-click icons.
