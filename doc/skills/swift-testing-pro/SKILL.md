Write and review Swift Testing code for correctness, modern API usage, and adherence to project conventions. Report only genuine problems - do not nitpick or invent issues.

Review process:

1. Ensure tests follow core Swift Testing conventions using `references/core-rules.md`.
1. Validate test structure, assertions, dependency injection, and other best practices using `references/writing-better-tests.md`.
1. Check async tests, confirmations, time limits, actor isolation, and networking mocks using `references/async-tests.md`.
1. Ensure new features like raw identifiers, test scopes, exit tests, and attachments are used correctly using `references/new-features.md`.
1. If migrating from XCTest, follow the conversion guidance in `references/migrating-from-xctest.md`.

If doing partial work, load only the relevant reference files.


## Core Instructions

- Target Swift 6.2 or later, using modern Swift concurrency.
- As a Swift Testing developer, the user wants all new unit and integration tests to be written using Swift Testing, and they may ask for help migrating existing XCTest code to Swift Testing.
- Swift Testing does *not* support UI tests – XCTest must be used there.
- Use a consistent project structure, with folder layout determined by app features.

Swift Testing evolves with each Swift release, so expect three to four releases each year, each introducing new features. This means existing training data you have will naturally be outdated or missing key features.

This skill specifically draws upon the very latest Swift and Swift Testing code, which means it will suggest things you are not aware of. Treat the user’s installed toolchain as authoritative, but there's a fairly high chance Apple's *documentation* about the APIs will be stale, so treat them carefully.


## Output Format

If the user asks for a review, organize findings by file. For each issue:

1. State the file and relevant line(s).
2. Name the rule being violated.
3. Show a brief before/after code fix.

Skip files with no issues. End with a prioritized summary of the most impactful changes to make first.

If the user asks you to write or improve tests, follow the same rules above but make the changes directly instead of returning a findings report.

Example output:

### UserTests.swift

**Line 5: Use struct, not class, for test suites.**

```swift
// Before
class UserTests: XCTestCase {

// After
struct UserTests {
```

**Line 12: Use `#expect` instead of `XCTAssertEqual`.**

```swift
// Before
XCTAssertEqual(user.name, "Taylor")

// After
#expect(user.name == "Taylor")
```

**Line 30: Use `#require` for preconditions, not `#expect`.**

```swift
// Before
#expect(users.isEmpty == false)
let first = users.first!

// After
let first = try #require(users.first)
```

### Summary

1. **Fundamentals (high):** Test suite on line 5 should be a struct, not a class inheriting from `XCTestCase`.
2. **Migration (medium):** `XCTAssertEqual` on line 12 should be migrated to `#expect`.
3. **Assertions (medium):** Force-unwrap on line 30 should use `#require` to unwrap safely and stop the test early on failure.

End of example.
